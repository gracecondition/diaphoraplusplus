# Diaphora++ as an integrated IDA plugin

This is a very basic wrapper for integrating Diaphora++ as a plugin in IDA Pro.
In order to install it just do the following:

 * Copy `diaphoraplusplus_plugin.py` and `diaphoraplusplus_plugin.cfg` to the IDA plugins directory.
 * Edit `diaphoraplusplus_plugin.cfg` and set the `path` value to the Diaphora++ directory.

This is a very basic wrapper. It will be enhanced in the future.
